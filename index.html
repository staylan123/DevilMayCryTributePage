                    <h6>Note: This is a quick rundown of what the Devil May Cry series about, details of each game will be coming in the later sections.</h6>
                    <p>The Devil May Cry game series is a hack-n-slash game series developed and published by Capcom. It follows the story of the Legendary Dark Knight Dante, a half demon-human hybrid who becomes
                        the ultimate demon hunter.</p>
                        
                    <p>The game series began back in 2001, after a failed attempt in creating a new Resident Evil game. It was designed to be the ultimate hack-n-slash experince giving the player an action oriented gameplay system
                        in which they attempt to produce over the top combos. These combos are generated with the weapons and abilties learned throughout the game, offering nearly endless possiblities of unique attack patterns. In order
                        to give the player a challenge a ranking system was created to gauge the players called the "stylish-system". This system ranks the players combos based off how often a player switches up their attack patterns,
                        rewarding those who keep their combos different, rather than simple. The system also encoruages players to avoid enemy attacks, as getting hit resets this raning system resulting in a poor grade at the end of
                        a given mission. This system has become a staple throughout all the games in the series, giving the players the challenge of mastering the combat to become worthy of being the ultimate demon hunter.
                    </p>
