            <h4>The Story</h4>
            <p style="color: red;"><strong>WARNING: SPOILERS PRESENT IN PLOT - LEAVE NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RUIN THE
                    SERIES FOR YOURSELF</strong></p>
            <p>
                This game is a prequel to the series, about Dante's early days of being a demon hunter. It start's off
                with Dante in his newly yet-to-be-named shop, where a mysterious man enters. This man
                Dante that he's working with his twin brother Vergil, and speaks about the history of who Sparda was.
                Before leaving the man says that he was sent to invite Dante by Vergil before vanishing. Dante
                is then ambushed by a group of demons which he easily defeats. Dante see's a tower emerge from the
                ground called Temen-ni-gru, which is where his brother is waiting for him. Therefore Dante gears up,
                and sets off the meet his brother.
            </p>
            <p>
                When entering the tower, he's greeted by a demonic three headed dog named Cerberus who guards the main
                entance, telling Dante to leave. Dante decides to fight this demonic foe, and wins with easy obtaining
                its soul to create a devil arm (demonic weapons Dante creates from the essence of the demons he beats).
                Before going further a women arrives on a motercycle carring several weapon of her own, peaking Dantes
                interest, but she remains silent and rides past him. Waiting atop of the tower Vergil is greeted by
                Arkham (the mysterious man who invited Dante to come to the tower), who informs him of Dantes arrival as
                well
                as the women. It's revealed that the women was his very own daughter (Mary) who was out to kill him as
                he had sacerficed her mother (his wife) to gain power. Vergil wasn't bothered, and only had his interest
                on
                facing Dante to obtain the ambulet he carried. This ambulet was broken into two halves that enabled for
                the power of Sparda to be used, something Vergil seeked (MORE POWER).
            </p>
            <p>
                Dante battles his way throughout the tower facing many demonic foes and obtaining more demonic weapons
                along the way. He runs into a strange Jester like being that tells him about the tower, and vanishes
                before Dante could fight him. Dante proceeds to make his way up the tower finally coming face to face
                with his twin brother. Vergil explains to Dante he wants the ambulet which Dante refuses to give. The
                two brothers
                fight and Dante is overpowered and impaled by his own sword. Dante in anger and having his own blood
                touch his sword awakes his true demonic power before collapsing in defeat. He then awakes feeling
                powerful,
                and proceeds to dive off the tower before being swallowed by a large creature named Leviathan. He fights
                the monster from within before killing it and running into Mary the women he saw earlier. The two of
                them
                split ways and he gives her the nick-name Lady.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dante proceeds to look for Vergil who was preparing to create the Force Edge they key to obtaining the
                power of Sparda. Vergil betrays Arkham as he no longer needed him killing him, and proceeds his plan
                to awakening his fathers power. Dante catches up with Vergil and once again the fight, until they are
                stopped by Lady who believes Vergil is to blame for her fathers actions. Suddenly the Jester appears
                amoungst them and thanks them for gathering all the materials needed to awaken Spardas power and reveals
                that he was Arkham all along. He overpowers Dante and Vergil and uses the blood of his daugter to
                complete
                the ritual. Arkham is transported to the top of the tower where he seeks to become a demonic god.
            </p>
            <p>Dante decides to make his way up the tower once again to stop Arkham, and comes face to face with Lady
                who had the same plan. She explains how he was her father and wanted to avenge her mothers death. Her
                goal is to
                kill her father, whom Dante assures he can take care of. Before parting ways she gives him her rocket
                weapon wishing him luck. Dante arrives to the top of the tower to confront Arkham who had mutated into a
                hidious
                demon. Vergil arrives and teams up with Dante bringing Arkham demonic form down, causing Arkham to
                return to his former self. Vergil tells him that he wishes to keep Sparda's power and requests Dante to
                hand over the Force Edge and ambulet to which Dante refuses. The two brothers battle, leaving Dante to
                be the victor, Vergil tells Dante he wishes to stay in the demon world, and proceeds to jump deeper into
                the abyss before Dante could stop him. Dante returns to the human world with his new sword, and runs
                into Lady who had finshed off her dying father. The two exchange words and she attempts to confort Dante
                who is sadden by the loss of his brother. She tells him "devil may cry", as Dante hides his tears
                claiming it's the rain stating that "devils never cry". Dante returns home and names his shop "Devil May
                Cry".
