            <h4>The Story</h4>
            <p style="color: red;"><strong>WARNING: SPOILERS PRESENT IN PLOT - LEAVE NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RUIN THE
                    SERIES FOR YOURSELF</strong></p>
            <p>
                The game opens with a new character named Nero making his way to an Opera house in Fortuna, so he can
                watch Kyrie (his love interest) perform. He faces demons along the way, and he appears to have on of his
                arms in a sling,
                hiding it from view. After arriving he waits for her performance to end, and they both wait for Sanctus
                (head priest) to ask everyone to join their prayers for Sparda as they worshipped him. Growing bored
                Nero
                begins to leave before his arm begins to glow alerting him that something was near. Dante comes crashing
                down from the ceiling and proceeds to assassinate Sanctus causing mass panic within the opera house.
                Nero tells Kyrie to run and attacks Dante initiating a fight between the two. After exchanging blows,
                when Nero's arm in the sling is revealed to be a demonic arm which he uses to nearly kill Dante. After
                impaling
                Dante with his own sword, he is shocked to see that he's still alive and is told by Nero that he is
                similar to him before disappearing. Credo (Kyrie's brother and head of the knights) arrives asking Nero
                to persue Dante.
            </p>
            <p>
                Screams are heard outside, as demon begin attacking the city, which Nero begins battling. He makes his
                way to Fortuna castle facing many demonic foes along the way. He meets a women named Gloria a new member
                to the Order, who tells him what's going on. Nero fights his way through the castle soon learning that
                the there was more to the Order than he though. It turns out that Agnus (a scientist) has been
                fusing demon souls to members of the Order turning them into demons. Sanctus was resurrected as a demon,
                and he planned to used the Savior (a powerful weapon in the form of Sparada) to become a god. Nero
                proceeds
                to make his way to Agnus's facility where he is attacked by several demonic knights. Agnus shows him a
                broken Katana (the Yamato - Vergils sword) explaining how it allows him to create these demonic beings
                and is
                the key to opening the demon world. Nearly dying Nero arm begins to react to the Yamato's presence
                flinging towards him and repairing itself. Horrified Agnus flee's as Neros demonic powers awaken, before
                he collpases form
                exhaustion. Agnus reports back to Sanctus, and tells him about what had happened, causing Credo to vow
                that he'll stop Nero from interfearing with their plans.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nero continues his persuit to find out what the Order was after, and once again runs into Dante. Dante
                asks for Nero to return the Yamato to him as it belonged to his brother, to which Nero said he needed.
                The two
                battle, with Dante defeating Nero, but tells him to hold onto the Yamato so he can persue to Order. The
                two exhange names, and split ways. Dante runs into Gloria who is revealed to be Trish in disguise who
                informs
                Dante about what she learned about the Order. Nero runs into Credo, who tells Nero to stop persuing the
                Order to which Nero refuses. Credo who was convinced he has been given the powers of an angel reveals
                his demonic form. The two battle, but are stopped
                when Kyrie arrives horrfied that her brother and Nero were fighting. Agnus arrives kidnapping Kyrie
                causing Credo to become angered, who puts off his battle with Nero. Nero is determined to save Kyrie at
                all costs and
                finds himself face to face with Sanctus. Sanctus explains his plans to awaken the Savior which requires
                an essense of Sparda (in this case Nero - hmmmmm) and the Yamato. He is able to detain Nero using Kyrie
                as a hostage, causing him to be absorbed by the Savior. Credo arrives trying to stop
                Sanctus, but is put down in an instant. With the Savior now at full power, Sanctus makes his way back to
                Fortuna city claiming he will be a god. Dante arrives finding an injured Credo who asks him to stop
                Sanctus, and to
                save Nero and Kyrie as his last request before dying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dante begins to make his way after the Savior fighting demonic forces along the way, while destroying
                Hell Gates (portals to the demon world) along the way. He arrives to the opera house to find Agnus
                waiting him.
                Agnus is killed by Dante, who now has regained possesion of the Yamato. Dante makes his way to the
                Savior to which he discovers in indestructable from the outside, causing him to throw the Yamato into
                it's chest. He
                calls for Nero who is trapped within the savior to take the Yamato and defeat Sanctus and save Kyrie.
                Nero is now freed and makes his way through the Savior to put an end to Sanctus. The two battle, but
                Nero is left
                victorious; destroying the Savior and saving Kyrie. Sanctus uses the last of his power to activate the
                Savior once again, but is stopped by Nero who uses his Devil Bringer (demonic arm) to destroy them both
                once
                and for all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dante meets up with Nero and congratulates him for a job well done. Nero attempts to return the Yamato to
                him, to which Dante tells him that he is entrusting it to him. The two split ways but it is hinted
                they will cross paths again.
