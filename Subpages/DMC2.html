            <h4>The Story</h4>
            <p style="color: red;"><strong>WARNING: SPOILERS PRESENT IN PLOT - LEAVE NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RUIN THE
                    SERIES FOR YOURSELF</strong></p>
            <p>
                The story begins with Dante and a women of the name Lucia meeting in a museum which contains an artifact
                called the Arcana Medaglia, as it's a key element into releasing the powerful demon Argosax. Lucia asks
                Dante to accompany her to Vile de Marli where he meets her adoptive mom Matier a women who once fought
                alongside Sparda. She tells Dante that Arius a evil buiness man plans to summon Argosax, and asks him to
                stop him. In this game Dante uses a coin flip to determine his actions, and upon landing on heads he
                agrees.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dante fights his way to confront Arius, but Lucia arrives there before him and learns she's his
                creation. She attempts to fight him but fails, to later be saved by Dante when he trades the Arcana to
                Arius. Lucia
                grows concerned about Arius now having the artifact and goes after him to stop the ritual. Dante stops
                her, and say's he'll take care of it and engages in a battle with Arius defeats him. He is then
                confronted
                by Lucia who requests Dante to kill her as she fears she'll become a mindless demon to which Dante
                refuses. A portal then opens up to the demon world where Argosax dwells, causing Dante and Lucia to
                argue who would
                enter it to defeat him. Dante leaves it to a coin flip and "wins" it and leaves the coin as a token to
                remember him to Lucia, entering to portal to confront the powerful demon.
            </p>
            <p>Arius was still alive, and Lucia desides to fight him, ultimately winning the battle. In the demon world
                Dante faces angainst Agrosax and wins with ease, and discovers the portal was closed, and he'd be
                trapped in
                the demon world. He decides to ride his motorcycle deeper into the demon world ending the main story.
                Back in the human world Lucia discovers the coin Dante gave her was a two faced coin, and decides to go
                to Dantes office in hope she'll find him there. Sadly he wasn't but she does hear the distant engine of
                a motorcycle and goes to investigate.
            </p>
            <p>
                DMC2 is viewed as the worst DMC game in the series, for it's mess of a story. It's best to forget it,
                and just know Dante is stuck in the demon world at the end.
