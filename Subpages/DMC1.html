                She tells Dante that the demon emperor Mundus, the same demon responsible for the death of his mother is
                planning on returning and must be stopped at all costs. Dante agrees to help her and journeys
                to Mallet Island to find a mysterious castle gaurded by a variety of demons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dante now must fight his way through this demonic army, facing off against different gaurdians such as
                Phantom, a giant spider like creature who constantly persues him throughout the castle. Upon Phantoms
                defeat, he comes to realize that Dante is the son of Sparda the legardary knight that has once defeated
                Mundus himself. This sets Dante off to defeat the other powerful demons lurking in the castle
                such as Nightmare, and entity that is fear itself, and Griffon a large avian creature. However, one
                demon he
                faced was different which was Nelo Angelo the demonic knight. Dante struggled fighting him off
                and upon nearly being bested by him Nelo Angelo flees at the sight of Dantes amulet. It is later
                revealed
                that this demons true identity was Vergil, Dante's twin brother who was now under the control of Mundus.
                After being forced to fight his own brother, Dante defeats him and is heartbroken he had to put his own

                to
                lore him to the castle so he could be killed by Mundus. Shocked, and angered Dante overpowers but spares
                her life. He then continues his persuit to destroying Mundus, who is far more power than he though.
                After
                engaging in battle Dante is nearly struck down but is saved by Trish who sacerfices herself to save him.
                Saddened by this Dante's true demonic power takes over transforming him into a demon resembling his
                father
                and chases after Mundus.

                After an epic battle Mundus is defeated, and Dante begins to leave the island just to find out Mundus is
                still alive and must engage in battle once again. Trish comes to the rescue as she had survived
                the blow, and together with Dante seals away Mundus once again. Mundus swears he'll one day
                return,
                and get is revenge. Dante and Trish leave the island together, and the two team up and become
                a devil hunting duo.
