                    <h6>Note: This is a quick rundown of what the Devil May Cry series about, details of each game will be coming in the later sections.</h6>
                    <p>The Devil May Cry game series is a hack-n-slash game series developed and published by Capcom. It follows the story of the Legendary Dark Knight Dante, a half demon-human hybrid who becomes
                        the ultimate demon hunter.</p>
                        
                    <p>The game series began back in 2001, after a failed attempt in creating a new Resident Evil game. It was designed to be the ultimate hack-n-slash experince giving the player an action oriented gameplay system
                        in which they attempt to produce over the top combos. These combos are generated with the weapons and abilties learned throughout the game, offering nearly endless possiblities of unique attack patterns. In order
                        to give the player a challenge a ranking system was created to gauge the players called the "stylish-system". This system ranks the players combos based off how often a player switches up their attack patterns,
                        rewarding those who keep their combos different, rather than simple. The system also encoruages players to avoid enemy attacks, as getting hit resets this raning system resulting in a poor grade at the end of
                        a given mission. This system has become a staple throughout all the games in the series, giving the players the challenge of mastering the combat to become worthy of being the ultimate demon hunter.
                    </p>

                        The story begins with Dante and a women of the name Lucia meeting in a museum which contains an artifact called the Arcana Medaglia, as it's a key element into releasing the powerful demon Argosax. Lucia asks
                        Dante to accompany her to Vile de Marli where he meets her adoptive mom Matier a women who once fought alongside Sparda. She tells Dante that Arius a evil buiness man plans to summon Argosax, and asks him to
                        stop him. In this game Dante uses a coin flip to determine his actions, and upon landing on heads he agrees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dante fights his way to confront Arius, but Lucia arrives there before him and learns she's his creation. She attempts to fight him but fails, to later be saved by Dante when he trades the Arcana to Arius. Lucia
                        grows concerned about Arius now having the artifact and goes after him to stop the ritual. Dante stops her, and say's he'll take care of it and engages in a battle with Arius defeats him. He is then confronted
                        by Lucia who requests Dante to kill her as she fears she'll become a mindless demon to which Dante refuses. A portal then opens up to the demon world where Argosax dwells, causing Dante and Lucia to argue who would
                        enter it to defeat him. Dante leaves it to a coin flip and "wins" it and leaves the coin as a token to remember him to Lucia, entering to portal to confront the powerful demon.
                    </p>
                    <p>Arius was still alive, and Lucia desides to fight him, ultimately winning the battle. In the demon world Dante faces angainst Agrosax and wins with ease, and discovers the portal was closed, and he'd be trapped in
                        the demon world. He decides to ride his motorcycle deeper into the demon world ending the main story. Back in the human world Lucia discovers the coin Dante gave her was a two faced coin, and decides to go
                        to Dantes office in hope she'll find him there. Sadly he wasn't but she does hear the distant engine of a motorcycle and goes to investigate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        DMC2 is viewed as the worst DMC game in the series, for it's mess of a story. It's best to forget it, and just know Dante is stuck in the demon world at the end.

                        This game is a prequel to the series, about Dante's early days of being a demon hunter. It start's off with Dante in his newly yet-to-be-named shop, where a mysterious man enters. This man

                        is then ambushed by a group of demons which he easily defeats. Dante see's a tower emerge from the ground called Temen-ni-gru, which is where his brother is waiting for him. Therefore Dante gears up,
                        and sets off the meet his brother.

                        When entering the tower, he's greeted by a demonic three headed dog named Cerberus who guards the main entance, telling Dante to leave. Dante decides to fight this demonic foe, and wins with easy obtaining
                        its soul to create a devil arm (demonic weapons Dante creates from the essence of the demons he beats). Before going further a women arrives on a motercycle carring several weapon of her own, peaking Dantes
                        interest, but she remains silent and rides past him. Waiting atop of the tower Vergil is greeted by Arkham (the mysterious man who invited Dante to come to the tower), who informs him of Dantes arrival as well
                        as the women. It's revealed that the women was his very own daughter (Mary) who was out to kill him as he had sacerficed her mother (his wife) to gain power. Vergil wasn't bothered, and only had his interest on
                        facing Dante to obtain the ambulet he carried. This ambulet was broken into two halves that enabled for the power of Sparda to be used, something Vergil seeked (MORE POWER).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dante battles his way throughout the tower facing many demonic foes and obtaining more demonic weapons along the way. He runs into a strange Jester like being that tells him about the tower, and vanishes
                        before Dante could fight him. Dante proceeds to make his way up the tower finally coming face to face with his twin brother. Vergil explains to Dante he wants the ambulet which Dante refuses to give. The two brothers

                        and proceeds to dive off the tower before being swallowed by a large creature named Leviathan. He fights the monster from within before killing it and running into Mary the women he saw earlier. The two of them
                        split ways and he gives her the nick-name Lady.

                    <p>
                        Dante proceeds to look for Vergil who was preparing to create the Force Edge they key to obtaining the power of Sparda. Vergil betrays Arkham as he no longer needed him killing him, and proceeds his plan
                        to awakening his fathers power. Dante catches up with Vergil and once again the fight, until they are stopped by Lady who believes Vergil is to blame for her fathers actions. Suddenly the Jester appears
                        amoungst them and thanks them for gathering all the materials needed to awaken Spardas power and reveals that he was Arkham all along. He overpowers Dante and Vergil and uses the blood of his daugter to complete
                        the ritual. Arkham is transported to the top of the tower where he seeks to become a demonic god. 
                    </p>
